		We chose to implement fixed point arithmetic using an abstraction layer in the \code{src/lib/fixedpoint.h} file. The resultant \code{real} type was a \code{typedef} of an \code{unsigned int}, which allowed us to easily perform arithmetic operations on the sign, whole, and fractional bits of the number without having to deal with the intricacies of 2's complement arithmetic.
		
		This encapsulation of functionality allowed us to write the implementation code in one place, where we could thoroughly test it easily. Afterwards, the abstraction allowed us to use the \code{real} type without worrying about its implementation.
