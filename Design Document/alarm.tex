		After the \code{timer_sleep()} method is called, the current thread is added to \code{sleeping_threads_list}. The thread is then blocked, which makes it unrunnable. Whenever interrupts occur, we iterate over \code{sleeping_threads_list} to find threads that are either due or overdue to run. For each of these threads:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Interrupts are disabled.
			\item The thread is removed from \code{sleeping_threads_list}.
			\item The thread is unblocked (making it ready).
			\item Interrupts are reenabled.
		\end{enumerate}

		The duration of the interrupt handler is minimized by disabling interrupts only after a thread to awaken has been found. Thus, the critical section is limited to the two steps of removing the thread from \code{sleeping_threads_list} and unblocking it.
